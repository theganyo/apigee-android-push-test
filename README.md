apigee-android-push-test
====================

A simple Android app that registers itself and pushes a GCM notification to itself via Apigee's App Services.

NOTE: 
If you are using eclipse, double check to see that eclipse is importing all the JAR files in the lib folder 
properly into the eclipse environment.
